When parents consistently come from a place of frustration, anger, or disapproval, children become subservient and aim to please. The loss of connection and love they feel when a parent is angry with them can be incredibly painful, and becomes a powerful form of influence. Of course, they still act out, do crazy things, and bug the heck out of their parents. But the shift takes place nonetheless, very slowly and subtly over time. Eventually this style of socialization turns politeness into a fear-based sense of following the rules. As children grow up they become scared of doing it wrong, afraid of making mistakes, terrified of being “rude,” and apologizing preemptively for things that are not even apology-worthy.

While it was uncomfortable, I was excited to identify this behavior because now I knew what I needed to work on in order to grow my confidence. I decided that one of my primary social goals was not to be intimidated by anyone, no matter how successful. The goal here is not to completely eliminate this desire for approval from your life. That’s an extreme demand, and probably impossible to do. Instead, notice where the urge for approval is strongest. And, as best as you can, do so with curiosity, compassion, and love.

Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success.

A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.

The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking.

At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment.

The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.

Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain.8 It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the nonconscious mind to do automatically.9

This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.10

If you’re always being forced to make decisions about simple tasks—when should I work out, where do I go to write, when do I pay the bills—then you have less time for freedom. It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.

Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future.

If you become anxious when you see a growling dog and begin to hyperventilate, that would be amygdala-initiated anxiety. If you’re pacing nervously as you anticipate an important phone call, that would be cortex-initiated anxiety. Understanding where and how your anxiety begins will allow you to take the most effective approach to interrupting the process.

It’s important to remember that when anxiety begins in the amygdala, cortex-based interventions, such as logic and reasoning, don’t always help reduce anxiety. Amygdala-based anxiety can often be identified by certain characteristics; for example, it seems to come from out of the blue, it creates strong physiological responses, and it seems out of proportion to the situation.

As explained in chapter 3, the left hemisphere of the cortex can produce a type of anxious apprehension that shows up as a tendency to worry about what will happen and search repetitively for solutions. With this type of anxiety, people tend to ruminate or focus intensely on a situation or feel the need to discuss a situation repeatedly.

Now, add to this response the fact that the amygdala is capable of identifying a situation as dangerous in just a fraction of a second, before the rest of the brain even knows exactly what the situation is. Other types of processing, such as perception, thinking, and retrieving memories from the cortex, may take more than a second to occur.

Doing so requires diverting the flow of information leaving the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. Rather than traveling to the central nucleus, information from the lateral nucleus is instead sent to the basal nucleus of the amygdala, which promotes active responses.

Initially, it’s important to just do something—anything at all. You may not feel capable of doing complicated or demanding tasks, but don’t allow yourself to freeze and become immobilized, like a frightened rabbit, because this will strengthen the wiring that underlies passive responding. Find something active you can do, even if it’s just calling someone on the phone. In fact, social activities that involve enjoyable interactions with others, or simple pleasurable activities that distract you from your worries, can keep your amygdala from creating responses characterized by freezing, avoidance, and immobilization.

When people are anxious, they’re likely to breathe quickly and shallowly. They may not get enough oxygen, which produces an uncomfortable sensation. Hyperventilation can also result, due to expelling carbon dioxide too quickly, resulting in low levels of carbon dioxide in the blood.

It’s similar to adding a bypass of a well-traveled area on a highway. When you create a new neural path and practice traveling it again and again, you establish an alternate route that avoids trouble. Responding with fear and anxiety is no longer your only option. You can establish other, calmer responses as a way around your anxiety.

With either approach, in most cases people initially confront feared situations mentally, by imagining themselves in the feared situation. But ultimately, they must directly experience the situation, usually repeatedly. Obviously, this is a challenging form of treatment, but research shows that it’s exactly the approach needed to rewire the amygdala (Amano, Unal, and Paré 2010). Therefore, the more you practice exposure, the more likely it is that your amygdala will respond calmly to previously feared situations and triggers.

You simply create a similar hierarchy of situations that provoke compulsive behaviors and then expose yourself to those situations without allowing yourself to perform compulsions in response.

Furthermore, exercise is helpful for people who are sensitive to the symptoms of anxiety, such as increased heart rate or breathlessness, because those sensations are also associated with exercise. Therefore, exercise can serve as a form of exposure that decreases people’s discomfort about those sensations (Broman-Fulks and Storey 2008).

Additional research involving rats running on their wheels has shown that exercise changes the chemistry of the amygdala, including altered levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine (Dunn et al. 1996) and serotonin (Bequet et al. 2001). Exercise appears to affect a certain type of serotonin receptor that’s found in large numbers in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (Greenwood et al. 2012). Regular exercise seems to make these receptors less active, resulting in a calmer amygdala that’s less likely to create an anxiety response (Heisler et al. 2007).

Some people tend to be optimistic and expect the best, while others are more pessimistic and expect the worst. Optimism is more common, and it tends to result in less anxiety. If you tend to be pessimistic, you’re likely to be more anxious. Furthermore, a pessimistic attitude can make you less willing to try to change your anxiety because you don’t expect success.

The nucleus accumbens, a structure in the frontal lobes, also plays a role in this. The nucleus accumbens is a pleasure center in the brain that’s involved in hope, optimism, and the anticipation of rewards. It’s where the neurotransmitter dopamine is released, and studies have shown that when brain levels of dopamine are higher, negative expectations are reduced and optimism increases (Sharot et al. 2012).

Neuroscientist Richard Davidson has found that the more activity there is in a person’s nucleus accumbens, the more positive outlook the person has (Davidson and Begley 2012). Davidson maintains that this part of the brain underlies optimistic approaches to life, and some researchers have indeed found that the nucleus accumbens reacts differently in pessimists than in optimists (Leknes et al. 2011). Other researchers have found that optimists are more likely to have more activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain structure in the frontal lobe (Sharot 2011).

In contrast to Noam, traumatized people become stuck, stopped in their growth because they can’t integrate new experiences into their lives. I was very moved when the veterans of Patton’s army gave me a World War II army-issue watch for Christmas, but it was a sad memento of the year their lives had effectively stopped: 1944.

Since at least 1889, when the French psychologist Pierre Janet published the first scientific account of traumatic stress,3 it has been recognized that trauma survivors are prone to “continue the action, or rather the (futile) attempt at action, which began when the thing happened.” Being able to move and do something to protect oneself is a critical factor in determining whether or not a horrible experience will leave long-lasting scars.

The more neuroscience discovers about the brain, the more we realize that it is a vast network of interconnected parts organized to help us survive and flourish. Knowing how these parts work together is essential to understanding how trauma affects every part of the human organism and can serve as an indispensable guide to resolving traumatic stress.

Top-down regulation involves strengthening the capacity of the watchtower to monitor your body’s sensations. Mindfulness meditation and yoga can help with this. Bottom-up regulation involves recalibrating the autonomic nervous system, (which, as we have seen, originates in the brain stem). We can access the ANS through breath, movement, or touch. Breathing is one of the few body functions under both conscious and autonomic control. In part 5 of this book we’ll explore specific techniques for increasing both top-down and bottom-up regulation.

That is where therapy comes in—is the beginning of bringing the emotions that were generated by trauma being able to feel, the capacity to observe oneself online. However, the bottom line is that the threat-perception system of the brain has changed, and people’s physical reactions are dictated by the imprint of the past.

But inappropriately prolonged escape or avoidance behavior would put the animal at a disadvantage in that successful species preservation demands reproduction which, in turn, depends upon feeding, shelter and mating activities all of which are reciprocals of avoidance and escape.3

Focusing on a shared history of trauma and victimization alleviates their searing sense of isolation, but usually at the price of having to deny their individual differences: Members can belong only if they conform to the common code.

Danger turns off our social-engagement system, decreases our responsiveness to the human voice, and increases our sensitivity to threatening sounds. Yet for many people panic and rage are preferable to the opposite: shutting down and becoming dead to the world. Activating flight/flight at least makes them feel energized.

There was almost no activation of any of the self-sensing areas of the brain: The MPFC, the anterior cingulate, the parietal cortex, and the insula did not light up at all; the only area that showed a slight activation was the posterior cingulate, which is responsible for basic orientation in space.

The lack of self-awareness in victims of chronic childhood trauma is sometimes so profound that they cannot recognize themselves in a mirror. Brain scans show that this is not the result of mere inattention: The structures in charge of self-recognition may be knocked out along with the structures related to self-experience.

She became truly involved in her therapy and was genuinely curious about her behavior, thoughts, and feelings. She stopped picking at her skin, and when summer came she started to spend evenings sitting outside on her stoop, chatting with her neighbors. She even joined a church choir, a wonderful experience of group synchrony.

Now, in sales, when we talk about certainty, the first thing that pops into people’s minds is certainty about the actual product being sold.

I’m talking about the actual facts and figures, the features and benefits, and the long-term value proposition, as it relates specifically to that prospect. In other words, from a sober, emotionless perspective, does the idea or thesis that you’ve presented to them make sense? Does your product or service truly fill their needs? Is it priced fairly when compared to the competition? Does the cost-benefit ratio make it an unequivocally great deal?

On the flip side, emotional certainty is based on a gut feeling that something must be good. Once it hits us, we feel a craving inside that simply must be fulfilled, even if there’s a heavy price to pay for fulfilling it.

Remember, it’s not the job of salespeople to turn nos into yeses; it’s simply not what they do. Instead, we turn “Let me think about it” into a yes, and “Let me call you back” into a yes, and “I need to speak to my wife” into a yes, and “It’s a bad time of year” into a yes.

By midnight, I had laid out the framework for the entire system, and had created the first Straight Line Syntax. Consisting of eight distinct steps, the syntax served as a simple road map for taking a prospect down the straight line. It showed the Strattonites what to do first, what to do second, what to do third … all the way down to the eighth and final step, where the prospect either said yes, and opened an account with you, or he stuck to whatever objection he’d been using as his smoke screen, and you ended the call, respectfully, and moved on to the next prospect.

However, that being said, what you need to remember here is that this is not the type of process that happens all at once. In fact, in the vast majority of cases, you’re going to have to ask for the order at least two or three times before you have any chance of your prospect saying yes.

Three Tens even further, and with an ultimate goal of getting the prospect as close as possible to a “10, 10, 10,” both logically and emotionally, which gives the salesperson the best possible chance of closing the deal. The Straight Line technique that we use to accomplish this is called looping.

Now, that’s all fine and dandy, but what makes this concept so absolutely crucial to a salesperson’s success is a remarkable discovery I made that proved to be the linchpin strategy that allowed people with very little natural sales ability to close at the same level as a natural born salesperson, namely: that a prospect’s action threshold is malleable; it is not set in stone.

I need to genuinely believe in that value before I sell a product or service, and then I’ll describe it passionately. I also have to have a firm belief in the company that the product and I represent. This is what allows me to act enthusiastically in any sales situation.

but it also causes them to defer to me and basically hand over control of the sale. To demonstrate this authority, I translate features of the service or product into benefits and value for the prospect, while using technical industry lingo that I’ve taken the time to simplify—allowing the prospect to easily grasp what appear to be very complex statements. I’ll also add value by offering a unique perspective during the sales conversation, demonstrating extensive knowledge and understanding of the market, industry, product, prospect, and competitors.

In addition, once the prospect has come to this positive conclusion about you, their brain will instantly extrapolate your value to its logical end, which is: You can help them achieve their goals. You can help get them what they want in life. It could be a core need they’re looking to fulfill; it could be a simple want or desire; it could be to gain control over a certain aspect of their life; or, at the highest level, it could be to alleviate a pain they’re feeling.

And, again, because the human brain is so naturally adept at this, it takes less than four short seconds for your prospect to rip you apart, analyze each piece of you, and then put you back together based on how you were perceived.

That’s why the Straight Line System is as much about becoming an expert listener as an expert talker. However, to truly become an expert listener, you first need to learn how to take immediate control of the sale. There’s simply no other way. The million-dollar question is how?

Think about that for a moment. What could you say to try to get all that across in those first four seconds? You’d have to be literally yelling at your prospect, “Hey, Bill, listen to me! I’m sharp as a tack! I’m enthusiastic! I’m an expert in my field! I swear, I swear, I swear …” and blah, blah, blah. You’d sound like a freaking idiot! Not to mention that, even if it all were true, no one would believe you anyway.

For example, when I was a kid and I did something wrong, my mom would say “Jordan!” in a stern, no-nonsense voice, and without her having to say another word, I immediately knew that I was in serious trouble. Conversely, if she said “Jor-dan!” in a singsong tone, then I immediately knew that things were fine.

Serving as the dual linchpins of an immensely powerful communication strategy known as unconscious communication, tonality and body language play major roles in how we get our point across—both while we’re talking and as we’re listening.

In terms of percentages, tonality and body language comprise approximately 90 percent of our overall communication, split evenly down the middle, with each modality having approximately a 45 percent impact, depending on which study you buy into (and there are more of them than you can count). The remaining 10 percent of communication is comprised of our words—meaning, the actual words we say as we verbally communicate.

You’ve actually misinterpreted the meaning of my words! You see, despite comprising only 10 percent of our communication, words aren’t just important; they’re actually the single most important element of our communication strategy, but—and this is a very big but—only when we finally open up our mouths to speak. In other words, 90 percent of the time, we’re communicating without actually speaking!

A New Earth (Tolle, Eckhart)
- Your Highlight at location 216-219 | Added on Sunday, 7 November 2021 01:24:04

The primary factor in all of this is your state of consciousness in the only time there is: the Now! Make sure the present moment is your friend, not your enemy. Honor it by giving it your fullest attention. Appreciate it by being thankful for it. Become internally aligned with it by allowing it to be as it is. That is the arising of the new earth.

The gravity in this room is too high. It’s 15 meters per second per second when it should be 9.8. That’s why things falling “feel” wrong to me. They’re falling too fast. And that’s why I’m so weak despite these muscles. Everything weighs one and a half times as much as it should.

Light. Whatever their navigation system was, it was based on light. I suspected that would be the case. What else could you use in space? There’s no sound. No smell. It would have to be light, gravity, or electromagnetism. And light’s the easiest of those three to detect. At least, as far as evolution is concerned.

Why did they move randomly? My theory: By pure chance, every few seconds or so, an Astrophage thought it had spotted Venus. So it thrusted in that direction. But then the moment passed, so it stopped thrusting.

Venus’s atmosphere is ninety times Earth’s pressure and almost entirely carbon dioxide. Its spectroscopy signature of CO2 would be overwhelmingly strong. Mercury had no carbon dioxide at all, so the nearest competitor would be Earth. But we had a minuscule CO2 signature compared to Venus. Maybe Astrophage used emission spectra to find Venus? New plan!

Erid has all of those features on steroids. They are larger than Earth, with a larger iron core. They are close to their star, so they have a much stronger magnetic field powering their own field, and they spin extremely fast. All told, Erid’s magnetic field is at least twenty-five times as strong as Earth’s. Plus, their atmosphere is extremely

Eridians invented space travel quite a while ago. And with their unparalleled materials technology (xenonite) they actually made a space elevator. Basically a cable leading from Erid’s equator up to the synchronous orbit with a counterweight. They literally take elevators to get into orbit. We could do that on Earth if we knew how to make xenonite.

They have two separate circulatory systems: the “ambient” system and the “hot” system. The ambient blood is 210 degrees Celsius. But the hot blood is kept at 305 degrees, which is hot enough to boil water even at Erid’s air pressure. Both circulatory systems have blood vessels that expand or contract around the muscles as needed to set their temperature. Want to expand? Make it hot. Want to contract? Make it cold. In short: Eridians are steam-powered.

But the sound of objects colliding isn’t going to have much variance from planet to planet.

The other phrase that has hardened into cliché through overuse is “positive thinking.” When it is oversimplified and used as some quick-fix mantra, positive thinking becomes a way of whitewashing or sugarcoating your reality. When you are unable to process real-time information and control your psychological drama, you seize on “positive thinking” as a tranquilizer. Initially, it might seem to imbue your life with new confidence and optimism. But it is essentially limited. In the long term, if you deny or amputate one part of reality, it gives you a lopsided perspective of life.

As a guru, I have no doctrine to teach, no philosophy to impart, no belief to propagate. And that is because the only solution for all the ills that plague humanity is self-transformation. Self-transformation is not incremental self-improvement. Self-transformation is achieved not by morals or ethics or attitudinal or behavioral changes, but by experiencing the limitless nature of who we are. Self-transformation means nothing of the old remains. It is a dimensional shift in the way you perceive and experience life.

At that moment, I was able to experience the miraculous alchemy of human digestion—the process by which an external substance, a piece of the planet, was becoming a part of me. We all know this intellectually—that a part of the planet nourishes us, and our bodies, in turn, one day return to nourish the very same earth that once sustained us.

There is something within every human being that dislikes boundaries, that is longing to become boundless. Human nature is such that we always yearn to be something more than what we are right now. No matter how much we achieve, we still want to be something more. If we just looked at this closely, we would realize that this longing is not for more; this longing is for all. We are all seeking to become infinite. The only problem is that we are seeking it in installments.

Imagine that you were locked up in a cubicle of five feet by five feet. However comfortable it is, you would long to be free of it. The next day, if you were released into a larger cubicle of ten feet by ten feet, you would feel great for a while, but soon the same longing to break that boundary would return. It does not matter how large a boundary we set, the moment you become conscious of it, the longing to break it is instinctive. In the East, this longing has been culturally recognized as the highest goal of all human activity and endeavor. Freedom—or mukti or moksha—is seen as the natural longing in every human being and our ultimate destination.

The moment I realized that human desire was not for any particular thing, but just to expand illimitably, a certain clarity rose within me. When I saw that everyone is capable of this, it felt natural to want to share it. My whole aim since then has been to somehow rub this experience off on other people, to awaken them to the fact that this state of joy, of freedom, of limitlessness cannot be denied to them unless they stand in the way of the natural effervescence of life.

They can indeed bring on worry, doubt, fear, and a host of other negative feelings, or they can serve as cues to us to go back to a personal store of remembered successes.

Taken further, your confidence regarding any single aspect of your “game” is the total of all the thoughts you have about that aspect (forehand, backhand, first serve, second serve, volleys, etc., for tennis; passing, shooting, checking, etc., for hockey; budgeting, forecasting, employee management, etc., for business).

But this total of thoughts isn’t a static, once-and-for-all tally. Instead, it changes constantly as each and every new thought and new memory is added to it, making it a “running total,” a momentary sum of everything that you’ve thought about yourself and your abilities, a sum that is always changing depending on (1) how you are thinking at any time, (2) which aspects of your experience you are choosing to focus and linger on at any moment, and (3) how much emotion you invest in which particular thoughts and which particular memories.

Conversely, if your emotional state is driven by a flood of constructive thoughts (notice I did not say “positive” thoughts), it produces a rather different and vastly more effective physical state. Instead of feeling tense, you feel energized; your vision opens up instead of closing in; there are natural pain-reducing chemicals released in the brain. All these changes make your best possible performance far more likely, as pictured below:

million miles an hour,” the very things that tell you that you are “nervous”—are in fact signals from your body that it has tapped into some high-octane rocket fuel and is now ready to perform. If you are experiencing any of these signals, it simply means your body is doing something to help you do something that matters to you.

Unfortunately, I have seen far too many performers choose the damaging sewer option. Why? It probably has to do with your early experiences in performance moments, when you were new to a sport or a task or a situation that you hadn’t yet developed skill or competency at. Being unskilled, it’s likely you experienced relatively little success, and as each of these unsuccessful moments were preceded by your body’s natural adrenaline and arousal, you likely learned to associate this arousal with a soon-to-follow disappointment.

It’s just a momentary cognition, a still photo or short video in your mind’s eye, a “highlight” with a very small h, but it’s a constructive thought just the same—it’s what you want more of, and the science tells us that thinking about what you want more of is the first step in actually getting more of it.5 Now you line up for the next drill and proceed

With those dozen small highlights so deposited, once you get back to the locker room and pull out that notebook or tablet to do your daily E-S-P, you have a ton of great material to work with. Now you can easily reflect on your practice as a whole and quickly identify the day’s E’s, S’s, and P’s. What’s more, by taking the best rep of the last drill with you into the next drill, I’ll bet that you had a better overall practice than you would have otherwise. Why?

Upon hearing all this, and seriously reflecting on it, a new understanding slowly takes hold in my cadet advisees: perhaps the beliefs you have about yourself, expressed through what you say to yourself about yourself regarding a particular situation, are what ultimately determine what you actually experience in that situation. Perhaps there’s some truth to the old saying “people become what they think about” after all. Welcome to the self-fulfilling prophecy.

Assuming your imagination works like most people’s, and assuming you’ve handled a lemon before, the following things happened when you imagined biting into that imaginary lemon: your nostrils flared, the muscles around your mouth tightened, and you produced some saliva. Why? Because the elements of your autonomic nervous system, which (1) control the action of your facial muscles, (2) initiate digestion, and (3) allow you to taste what is in your mouth, all operated in the absence of an actual lemon.

As long as you control the content of your envisioned images, limiting them to scenes of success and progress, you can make valuable deposits into your mental bank account.

Achieving this high level of detail simply means engaging the maximum number of senses and dialing each one up to their highest intensity. This starts, obviously enough, with maxing the visual details in any imagined scene. Where is it taking place? Indoors? Outdoors? Which room or rooms? If it’s indoors, what do the walls, floors, and ceilings look like? If it’s outdoors, what do the ground, the surroundings, and the sky look like? Can you give the scene exact colors and “see” the position of any equipment, furniture, tools, teammates, opponents, coworkers?

With this enhanced degree of control and detail you can now move to more complex, more sequential, and more breakthrough-related mental images. Part Two: Practicing to Improve With your envisioning muscles now warmed up, let’s give them a little workout that will help you improve a skill that you’ll be using in an upcoming performance. For this exercise, select a technical skill from your sport, or a task you perform in your workday that you would like to improve. Select something that you know you’ll need in an upcoming game or test, or one that is commonly evaluated in your work and one that takes a relatively short time to complete. It could be anything from hitting a more powerful tennis serve (as opposed to playing an entire match), to playing a smoother short piece of music on an instrument (as opposed to playing the entire Third Brandenburg Concerto), to entering data faster into a database (as opposed to completing your entire monthly expense report). Envisioning the execution of this skill or task will initiate activity in the brain’s motor cortex and activate the nervous system pathways that control the task, due to the fact that your nervous system doesn’t distinguish very well between something you actually do and something you vividly imagine doing. With those nervous system pathways activated from motor cortex to spinal cord to your body’s periphery where the nerves connect up with your muscles, you might feel a slight twitch as you envision moving.

Jesus tells us to contemplate the flowers and learn from them how to live. The Buddha is said to have given a “silent sermon” once during which he held up a flower and gazed at it. After a while, one of those present, a monk called Mahakasyapa, began to smile. He is said to have been the only one who had understood the sermon. According to legend, that smile (that is to say, realization) was handed down by twenty-eight successive masters and much later became the origin of Zen.

Partly as a result of the spiritual teachings that have arisen outside the established religions, but also due to an influx of the ancient Eastern wisdom teachings, a growing number of followers of traditional religions are able to let go of identification with form, dogma, and rigid belief systems and discover the original depth that is hidden within their own spiritual tradition at the same time as they discover the depth within themselves.

Most of the time it is not you who speaks when you say or think “I” but some aspect of that mental construct, the egoic self. Once you awaken, you still use the word “I,” but it will come from a much deeper place within yourself.

So when I identify with something, I “make it the same.” The same as what? The same as I. I endow it with a sense of self, and so it becomes part of my “identity.” One of the most basic levels of identification is with things:

And so in many cases you are not buying a product but an “identity enhancer.” Designer labels are primarily collective identities that you buy into. They are expensive and therefore “exclusive.” If everybody could buy them, they would lose their psychological value and all you would be left with would be their material value, which likely amounts to a fraction of what you paid.

How you are seen by others becomes the mirror that tells you what you are like and who you are. The ego’s sense of self-worth is in most cases bound up with the worth you have in the eyes of others. You need others to give you a sense of self, and if you live in a culture that to a large extent equates self-worth with how much and what you have, if you cannot look through this collective delusion, you will be condemned to chasing after things for the rest of your life in the vain hope of finding your worth and completion of your sense of self there.

You then unconsciously cling to the illness because it has become the most important part of who you perceive yourself to be. It has become another thought form with which the ego can identify.

Once the ego has found an identity, it does not want to let go. Amazingly but not infrequently, the ego in search of a stronger identity can and does create illnesses in order to strengthen itself through them.

Forms are not just material objects and physical bodies. More fundamental than the external forms—things and bodies—are the thought forms that continuously arise in the field of consciousness. They are energy formations, finer and less dense than physical matter, but they are forms nonetheless. What you may be aware of as a voice in your head that never stops speaking is the stream of incessant and compulsive thinking. When every thought absorbs your attention completely, when you are so identified with the voice in your head and the emotions that accompany it that you lose yourself in every thought and every emotion, then

Ego is a conglomeration of recurring thought forms and conditioned mental-emotional patterns that are invested with a sense of I, a sense of self. Ego arises when your sense of Beingness, of “I Am,” which is formless consciousness, gets mixed up with form. This is the meaning of identification.

Yielding means inner acceptance of what is. You are open to life. Resistance is an inner contraction, a hardening of the shell of the ego. You are closed. Whatever action you take in a state of inner resistance (which we could also call negativity) will create more outer resistance, and the universe will not be on your side; life will not be helpful. If the shutters are closed, the sunlight cannot come in.

When you yield internally, when you surrender, a new dimension of consciousness opens up. If action is possible or necessary, your action will be in alignment with the whole and supported by creative intelligence, the unconditioned consciousness which in a state of inner openness you become one with. Circumstances and people then become helpful, cooperative. Coincidences happen. If no action is possible, you rest in the peace and inner stillness that come with surrender. You rest in God.

During the 2014 student protests in Hong Kong, one of the reasons the authorities did not quickly batter them off the streets – as they would have done in, for example, Ürümqi – was that the world’s cameras were there and would have captured the violence.

Beijing hesitated; it is playing the long game.

Rome’s collapse took the sting out of Christianity in Asia. Relations with Persia had improved in the face of their mutual interests in resisting the peoples of the steppe, and with the empire deeply enfeebled Christianity no longer looked as threatening – or perhaps even as convincing – as it had a century earlier, when Constantine was gearing up to attack Persia and liberate its Christian population. In 410, therefore, the first of several meetings took place, prompted by the Shah, Yazdagird I, to formalise the position of the Christian church in Persia and to standardise its beliefs.

created a small excel sheet application that after inputting all of someone’s goals, automatically generated over 100 meals perfectly suited to their macronutrient and calorie needs. Better yet, depending which meals they selected, would tell them what they needed to buy at the grocery store in exact amounts, and how to prepare them in bulk for their exact amounts. It took me about 100 hours to put the whole thing together.

But one year, I had a hip injury that kept me out for almost a season. I had to do a lot of time on the bikes and in the pool in recovery, away from the other boys. No one likes recovery as it’s as boring as hell, but you have to do it. The coach wasn’t much of a talker. But it still pisses me off that the only thing he said to me in those months was: “Plenty of young talent after your shirt, lad, and they are all better than you.”

As you can see from Team B’s response, shaming isn’t a good teacher or motivator. It’s too painful. When your greatest need is to avoid shame, you’re not worried about right and wrong, you’re worried about self-protection.

Our attempt to take control can take lots of different forms. We may become overly controlling of ourselves, make sure we are perfect, or judge ourselves harshly against rigid standards. Or we may become inflexible with other people and so judge or manipulate them too.

Ideally, control offers a counterweight to your impulses, moods and distractibility. It allows you to be productive, keeps your ambitions and efforts focused. It is closely linked with discipline, another tool that ensures you stick to the right codes, rules and routines for the best outcomes. Both of these are excellent mechanisms to use, but not to be used by.

However, when your head is full of not-good-enough fear, your way of compensating might be to work so damn hard that you cannot fail. Control tightens up and discipline becomes your religion.

You might turn these inflexible high standards outwards towards other people, too: becoming the boss who never lets up and emails her team every evening, the parent who pushes his child too hard, the friend who judges others for not keeping up to their own high standards of grooming or housekeeping or fitness.

The Appalachians, 1,500 miles long, are impressive, but compared to the Rockies, not particularly high. Nevertheless, they still formed a formidable barrier to westward movement for the early settlers, who were busy consolidating what territory they had subdued and preparing to govern it themselves. The colonists had another barrier, this one political. The British government forbade settlement west of the Appalachians as it wanted to ensure that trade, and taxes, remained on the Eastern seaboard.

The land stretched from the Gulf of Mexico north-west up to the headwaters of the tributaries of the Mississippi River in the Rocky Mountains.

Mexico controlled land all the way up to northern California, which the USA could live with, but it also stretched out east, including what is now Texas which, then as now, borders Louisiana.

other words, if a single dendritic fibril is excited, that’s not enough to pass on the excitation down to the axonal end and on to the next neuron. How does a message ever get passed on? Back to that wonderful drawing of a neuron by Cajal here

Which then opens up those same types of channels in the next smidgen of axonal membrane, regenerating the action potential there, and then the next, and the next, all the way down to the axon terminals.

The answer, whose pursuit dominated neuroscience in the middle half of the twentieth century, is that the electrical excitation doesn’t leap across the synapse. Instead it gets translated into a different type of signal.

The second option is for the neurotransmitter to be degraded in the synapse by an enzyme, with the breakdown products flushed out to sea (i.e., the extracellular environment, and from there on to the cerebrospinal fluid, the bloodstream, and eventually the bladder).
